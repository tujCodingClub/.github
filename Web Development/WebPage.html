		<p>
			Our goal is to create a platform for those interested in coding to gather. Everyone is welcome at the club, from aspiring developers to those without any experience. This is especially directed for those in the TUJ Computer Science major to connect with other Computer Science major students and more.</br>	Projects will be planned and done in the club where every member can contribute to the project. Members can be part of the planning as well as propose new ideas on upcoming projects.</br>	All those who are interested are encouraged to reach out! Come meet your fellow coders!
